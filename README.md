# CLIPMasterPrints: Fooling Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training Using Latent Variable Evolution

Wow, looks like you're very early :-) 

Our sincere apologies, there is no code here yet, but we will add it very soon.
In the meantime, why not have a look at some mined CLIPMasterPrints under ``` results/master_images``` and try them out with the [CLIP Interrogator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pharma/CLIP-Interrogator)? Choose "classic" to target OpenAIs CLIP model.
